## Why did I build this?

I decided to built this to show users where there are good trips you can take in those places well if provided by school,you can also visit those places.

I set these goals for my product:

1. Families/guardians should **have detailed knowledge** of higher-risk student activities.
2. Students should **practice engaging** with visualized spatial data to **independently answer their own questions** about each day's ride location, duration, elevation, Points of Interest, or itinerary.

## Tech stack

To build this app, I used the following tools:

1. I made a github account 
2. I used my tockens given by github to get in google.
3. I also used visual studio code.
4. I got some codes given by studio code and used those codes to get in the map
5. When I got in the map I placed the images and placed a desciption together with it.
